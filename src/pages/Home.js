        <h1>About</h1>
        <p> Hello there! I am Farya Bakhsh, a front-end developer currently living in Pakistan. As a career changer, I am looking to establish myself as a professional developer.<br /><br/>
        As an active member of #Udemy and #FrontendMaster community, I completed frontend development path. Moreover, to hone my skills further, I am taking Minor Courses of Computer Science from the university I am currently studying. <br /><br/>
        I am a passionate front-end developer that focuses on writing idiomatic, scalable and
         accessible code while prioritizing teamwork and collaboration with others as a part of
           my workflow. <br /> <br />
           When I am not coding, I'm spending time with my family. I am a huge fan of John Green's writings, so there is a good chance either I am reading one of his pieces or chatting about his work with my friends.
